## One hour delay

Changes that you make (creations, updates & deletions) can take up to an hour to show up on data.gov.uk for other people. Like many sites, data.gov.uk stores a cache of its content, so most people viewing data.gov.uk won't see changes for up to an hour.

You can check the real status of a record (ignoring the cached copy) by logging in. Logged-in users see the latest version of data.gov.uk. Non-logged-in users see the site as it was up to an hour behind. This is done to ensure the web-site pages load quickly for users.
