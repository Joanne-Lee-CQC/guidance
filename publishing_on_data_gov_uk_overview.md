To publish on Find open data, you must have an administrator (admin) or editor account. Both accounts allow you to create and edit datasets.

<h2 class="heading-large">How to get an account</h2>
<p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Go to [https://data.gov.uk/user/register](https://data.gov.uk/user/register). Choose a username and password to complete the registration. Click ‘Create new account’.
</li>
  <li>We’ll send an email within 30 minutes asking you to confirm the account details. We recommend checking your spam folder if you can’t see the email. Once you’ve validated your email address, we’ll activate the account.
</li>
  <li>You must confirm your email address within 5 days. After this, you’ll need to start again and create a new account.</li>
</ol>  
</p>

<p>
Once you have an account, you will need to request to become an editor or admin for your organisation.
</p>
 <h2 class="heading-large">Adding datasets</h2>
 <p>
  There are 2 ways to create a dataset and add links to your data. You can manually [add your dataset](https://guidance.data.gov.uk/dataset_form.html) from the Publisher tool or you can [harvest data](https://guidance.data.gov.uk/harvesting.html) to Find open data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Publishers must first publish the data on their own website, server or on GOV.UK. The publisher tool lets you add a link      to your data, but we do not host the data.</p>
