NB You can't upload _data_ to data.gov.uk. The data (e.g. spreadsheet file) should be published on your organization's website (which for central government is [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications)) and then you add to data.gov.uk a 'dataset' (record) containing information about the data, including the link to it (e.g. download URL).

There are two main methods for adding datasets to data.gov.uk:

1. Using the dataset (web) form. It is a simple & manual process. However it is not suitable for INSPIRE/Location datasets. More:

   * [Dataset form for adding/updating datasets](dataset_form.html)

2. Using a harvester. You store the dataset records on your own server and they are 'harvested' regularly into data.gov.uk. It requires some set-up, but it is ideal when there is already a published list of datasets on your site (or elsewhere). More:

   * [Harvesting data into data.gov.uk](harvesting.html)

Before this you need to [register a user account on data.gov.uk and get approved as 'editor' or 'admin' for your publisher](becoming_an_editor_or_admin.html).
