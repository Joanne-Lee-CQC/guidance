 <h2 class="heading-large">Adding datasets</h2>
 <p>
  There are 2 ways to create a dataset and add links to your data. You can manually add your dataset from the Data publisher or you can <a href="https://guidance.data.gov.uk/harvesting.html">harvest data</a> to Find open data on data.gov.uk.
  </p>
  <p>
   Publishers must first publish the data on their own website, server or on GOV.UK. The Data publisher will let publishers add a link to their data, but data.gov.uk does not host the data.</p>
