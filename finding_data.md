Whether you know exactly what data you want, or just want to browser, then data.gov.uk provides several tools to help.

## Search by keyword

On the [search page](http://data.gov.uk/data/search) you can click on the search box and type related words ('keywords'), like for a normal internet search engine.

When you press Enter or click on the magnifying glass icon, it will return the results.

You can change the order of the results using the 'Sort by' drop-down.

## Search by publisher

If you know the likely publishing organization, find it in the [publisher search](http://data.gov.uk/publisher).

Click on the publisher name to go through to the publisher's page.

The publisher's page lists their most popular datasets or you can try the search box. If you want to do the more advanced search, just click on the magnifying glass icon without typing any words, and it will take you to the main search page, but filtered for that publisher.

## Search by location

If you want data that covers a particular part of the UK, you can use the [Map Based Search](http://data.gov.uk/data/map-based-search).

It is important to note that although all this search will find many datasets, many other datasets' location have not been catalogued in data.gov.uk, and will not show up using this method of search. In which case you should also try keyword searches. e.g. for datasets in Salford you might also try searching for 'Salford', 'Birmingham' or 'West Midlands' as well as the using the "Map Based Search".


## Filters

You can browse datasets based on a number of criteria such as whether or not it is published, is in the NII or has an OGL licence. These are on the left-hand-side of the [search page](http://data.gov.uk/data/search).

Numbers in brackets denote the number of datasets meeting the criteria (out of the datasets returned for the currently selected search filters). Where criteria overlap, the numbers will add up to more than the total number of datasets. e.g. file formats, because a dataset can have multiple file formats.
