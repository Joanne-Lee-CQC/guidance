title: "Organogram transition October 2016"

IMPORTANT: Uploading of organogram data is currently disabled! The service is undergoing a short transition, as explained by the guidance below.

This page is to explain the transition for central government bodies to the new organogram system, launching on 3rd October 2016.

## Context

'Organograms' are the staff datasets that central government bodies are responsible for publishing on data.gov.uk every 6 months. Further information about this commitment is explained on: [Organogram data - Staff Roles and Salaries - publishing by central government](organogram-data.html).

## When?

* 29th September 2016 - existing submissions/uploads will be disabled (to allow for transition)

* 3rd October 2016 - new upload and view functionality launches

* 5th October 2016 - full guidance supplied and communicated to publishers

## What changes?

1. Publishers need to get themselves an account on data.gov.uk and apply for 'editor' or 'admin' permissions added to it. To avoid delays when you come to upload the next set of data, please do this in advance.

   Check if you have this already by going to: <https://data.gov.uk/user>, logging in and seeing if you have a blue 'Publisher Tools' appear at top-right:

   ![publisher tools button](images/become_editor_publisher_tools_button.png)

   If not, please register and become 'editor', by following these instructions:

   * [Getting an account](becoming_an_editor_or_admin.html#getting-an-account)
   * [Become an editor](becoming_an_editor_or_admin.html#become-an-editor)

2. The spreadsheet of data that you collect remains the same format/template as before. However the latest spreadsheet has updated department names. Publishers can download it here:

    [Blank_Organogram_Template_latest.xls](https://data.gov.uk/publisher-files/organogram_docs/Blank_Organogram_Template_latest.xls)

    If you are not already logged into data.gov.uk it will prompt you to log in first. If your user account does not have 'editor' or 'admin' permission, then you will need to obtain that first â€“ see [Becoming and editor or admin](becoming_an_editor_or_admin.html).

    To help filling in the spreadsheet, publishers can download this guidance:

    [Organograms and Senior Salaries - preparing the data](https://data.gov.uk/publisher-files/organogram_docs/OrganogramsPreparingTheDataGuidanceSeptember2016.pdf)

    (this document is an update of the previous "Organograms and Senior Salaries" guidance)

3. For you to submit/upload the data, instead of using organogram.data.gov.uk you should use the new [Organogram Publication](https://data.gov.uk/organogram/manage) section of data.gov.uk.

   Guidance for upload is available here: [Organogram upload](organogram-upload.html)

   This new system solves two key issues with the legacy system: providing detailed information of any errors in the spreadsheet, and allows publishers to load & reload data from *past* periods, if necessary.

4. You will no longer have to add the resulting CSV data files onto data.gov.uk - these will automatically be added as datasets.

5. The public will view the organogram diagrams on a simpler, improved page, particularly with regarding switching between organisations.

In the few days before launch, uploading spreadsheets will be disabled for a few days to enable the transition.
