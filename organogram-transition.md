title: "Organogram transition October 2016"
---

This page is to explain the transition for central government bodies to the new organogram system, launching on 3rd October 2016.

## Context

'Organograms' is the staff data that central government bodies are responsible for uploading to data.gov.uk every 6 months. Further information about this commitment is explained on: [Organogram data - Staff Roles and Salaries - publishing by central government](organogram-data.html).

## When?

* 28th September 2016 - existing uploads will be disabled (to allow for transition)

* 3rd October 2016 - new upload and view functionality launches

* 5th October 2016 - full guidance supplied and communicated to publishers

## What changes?

1. Publishers need to get themselves an account on data.gov.uk and apply for 'editor' or 'admin' permissions added to it. To avoid delays when you come to upload the next set of data, please do this in advance.

   Check if you have this already by going to: <https://data.gov.uk/user>, logging in and seeing if you have a blue 'Publisher Tools' appear at top-right:

   If not, please register and become 'editor', by following these instructions:

   * [Getting an account](becoming_an_editor_or_admin.html#getting-an-account)
   * [Become an editor](becoming_an_editor_or_admin.html#become-an-editor)


2. The spreadsheet of data that you collect remains the same format/template as before. If you want the latest template then [contact us](http://data.gov.uk/contact).

   Guidance for preparing the spreadsheet is available here: TBA (available to logged-in publishers only) (this document is an update of the previous "Organograms and Senior Salaries" guidance)

3. For you to upload the data, instead of using organogram.data.gov.uk you will be directed to a new part of data.gov.uk.

   Guidance for upload is available here: [Organogram upload](organogram-upload.html)

   This new system solves two key issues with the legacy system: providing detailed information of any errors in the spreadsheet, and allows publishers to load & reload data from *past* periods, if necessary.

4. You will no longer have to add the resulting CSV data files onto data.gov.uk - these will automatically be added as datasets.

5. The public will view the organogram diagrams on a simpler, improved page, particularly with regarding switching between organisations.

In the few days before launch, uploading spreadsheets will be disabled for a few days to enable the transition.

[Contact us](http://data.gov.uk/contact) with any questions.
