# INSPIRE scope

INSPIRE places obligations on these publishers and sorts of data:

* most UK public bodies (clarification needed)
* geo-spatial data (i.e. the data points contain a location e.g. latitude/longitude or post code etc)
* data that is in any of the [34 INSPIRE themes](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2/list/7), however UK Location encourages ALL geo-spatial data to be published the INSPIRE way
* published data (the law does not compel you to publish data that is not currently published)
