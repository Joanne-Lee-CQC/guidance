## Introduction

This page describes the technical detail of data.gov.uk's support of DCAT and data.json. DCAT and data.json are metadata formats suitable for harvesting into data.gov.uk. More about this is described here: [Harvesting Data into data.gov.uk - DCAT](harvesting.html#dcat)

## Dataset

| data.json field | DCAT predicate | Example value | Comments |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| title | dct:title <br> rdfs:label | Spend over Â£500 | Mandatory |
| description | dct:description <br> rdfs:comment | Spend transactions published monthly according to the Treasury transparency guidelines. | Mandatory |
| identifier | (equivalent to RDF object's URI or) dct:identifier | `https://data.some.org/catalog/datasets/9df8df51-63db-37a8-e044-0003ba9b0d98` or `http://dx.doi.org/10.7927/H4PZ56R2` | Mandatory. Must stay the same, even if the dataset's title changes. Must be globally unique - not just unique to the publisher. A URI is highly recommended (preferably an HTTP URL). |
| license | dct:license | `http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/` | Mandatory. Either a license URI or a title (must be exact or may not be recognized as open) |
| keyword | dcat:keyword | data.json: <br> `"keyword": {"geochemistry", "geology"}` <br> DCAT: `<dcat:keyword>geochemistry</dcat:keyword>` `<dcat:keyword>geology</dcat:keyword>` | Not displayed by data.gov.uk but helps theme categorization |
| issued | dct:issued | `2012-05-10T21:04` | Date of formal issuance. |
| modified | dct:modified | `2012-05-10T21:04` ||
| publisher | dct:publisher | data.json: <br> `"publisher": {"name": "Geological Society", "mbox": "info@gs.org"}` <br> DCAT: <br> `<dct:publisher>`<br>`    <foaf:Organization>`<br>`        <foaf:name>Geological Society</foaf:name>`<br>`        <foaf:mbox>info@gs.org </foaf:mbox>`<br>`    </foaf:Organization>`<br>`</dct:publisher>`||
| distribution | dcat:distribution || see "Distribution" table below|
| language | dct:language | `en` or `http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en` | Language of the data |
| frequency | dct:accrualPeriodicity | `R/P1Y` (=annual) <br> `R/P1W` (=weekly) | The frequency at which dataset is published. Format: ISO 8601 Repeating Duration (or `irregular`) See: <https://project-open-data.cio.gov/iso8601_guidance/#accrualperiodicity> |
| temporal | dct:temporal | `2000-01-15/2010-01-15` | The date period that the data applies to. Formatted as two ISO 8601 dates (or datetimes) separated by a slash. |
| spatial |  dct:spatial | `{\"type\":\"Polygon\",\"coordinates\":[[[2.072, 49.943],[2.072, 55.816], [-6.236, 55.816], [-6.236, 49.943], [2.072, 49.943]]]}` | The geographic location that the data applies to. If not specified, then it is inherited from the dataset's publisher. Formatted as a GeoJSON point, bounding box or polygon. |
| theme | dcat:theme | `http://eurovoc.europa.eu/209416` - Police - Eurovoc <br> `COFOG/03.1.0` Police services - COFOG <br> `http://id.esd.org.uk/function/20` - Police services - ESD | Main thematic category of the dataset. Preferably expressed as a URI from a known vocabulary: <br> [Eurovoc](http://eurovoc.europa.eu/) <br> [COFOG](https://github.com/datasets/cofog/blob/master/data/cofog.csv) <br> [ESD Service](http://standards.esd.org.uk/?uri=list%2Fservices)/[Function](http://standards.esd.org.uk/?uri=list%2Ffunctions) <br>More than one can be specified using a `[]` list. |

Local Authorities should ensure they add an ESD service or function URI as the dataset's theme, to ensure good classification.

## Distribution

| data.json field | DCAT predicate | Example value | Comments |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| downloadURL | dcat:downloadURL | `http://site.gov.uk/river-levels/dec2012.csv` | The direct URL that downloads a file |
| accessURL | dcat:accessURL | `http://www.site.gov.uk/api/sparql` <br> `http://site.gov.uk/river-level-data.html` | If there is not a downloadURL, specify the accessURL, which is the URL of an API or web page about the data |
| title | dct:title | Spend transactions, Dec 2012 |
| description | dct:description | | Not currently displayed on DGU |
| format | dcat:mediaType | `text/csv` | Currently recognized mime-types are listed here: [DGU formats](https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-dgu/blob/master/ckanext/dgu/lib/formats.py#L86) |
| conformsTo | dct:conformsTo | `http://schemas.opendata.esd.org.uk/publictoilets/PublicToilets.json?v=0.41` | URL of the machine-readable schema that the data conforms to. See: [Harvesting Guide - Appendix E - Local Authority data schemas (PDF)](http://data.gov.uk/sites/default/files/library/Harvesting%20guide.pdf). |
| temporal | dct:temporal | 2000-01-15/2010-01-15 | The date period that the data applies to. Formatted as two ISO 8601 dates (or datetimes) separated by a slash. |
| spatial |  dct:spatial | `{\"type\":\"Polygon\",\"coordinates\":[[[2.072, 49.943],[2.072, 55.816], [-6.236, 55.816], [-6.236, 49.943], [2.072, 49.943]]]}` | The geographic location that the data applies to. If not specified, then it is inherited from the dataset if not its publisher. Formatted as a GeoJSON point, bounding box or polygon. |

## Comparison with USA data.json schema

The UK data.json format is based on the Project Open Data data.json schema used by the U.S. Federal Government and agencies: <https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/>

However there are a few conscious differences that are listed here for reference:

| Field | Change | Explanation |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| bureauCode, programCode, primaryITInvestmentUII, systemOfRecords, dataQuality | not required | They are codes specific to US Federal Government |
| temporal, spatial | Can be applied to not just a dataset but also distributions. | e.g. Spend data is split up by months |
| spatial | Formatted with GeoJSON | GeoJSON is analagous to GML but preferred. Place name strings are not preferred as they can be ambiguous. |
| theme | The values are URIs from known classification vocabularies, rather than simply strings. | A catalogue chooses its own classification vocabularies, so there is little value in simple strings determined by the data publisher. Strings related to the data's topic can go in the keywords field. |
