From 3 October 2016, you can upload and publish organogram data (sometimes called 'organogram returns') to data.gov.uk.

Before you start, you must:

* [read our guidance] to find out what data your organisation must publish
* get a copy of the previous organogram spreadsheet or [download a new spreadsheet template]
* fill out the spreadsheet with your organisation data

## Get an editor account on data.gov.uk

You must have a data.gov.uk account with 'editor' or 'admin' permissions to publish organogram data.

1. [Sign in to data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/user) or [create an account](becoming_an_editor_or_admin.html#getting-an-account) if you don't already have one.

2. Look to see if you have the 'Publisher tools' button in the top menu - this indicates you have 'editor' permissions.

3. If you can't see the 'Publisher tools' button (or you want to publish organogram for an organisation which is not listed in the 'Publisher tools' button's drop-down menu), [apply to become an 'editor'].

[Contact us](http://data.gov.uk/contact) if you applied to become an editor and haven't heard back for a couple of days.

## Problems with uploading organograms

You won't be able to upload your organogram to data.gov.uk if there are any errors in your completed spreadsheet template.

When you're filling it in, make sure:

- you don't write in fields which should be filled in using options from a drop-down menu, such as 'Parent Department' or 'Grade'
- roles don't report to themselves
- roles don't report to a role that no longer exists ('Eliminated')
- the 'Valid?' column is green for every row

Check your spreadsheet and try to upload it again. Please refer to the guidance, which explains in detail how to complete every column. If you're still having problems, [contact us](http://data.gov.uk/contact).
