### If I make a mistake, can I delete a dataset?

You can always go back and edit a dataset but you cannot delete it.  If there is a need to delete a dataset you need to contact the Data.gov.uk team (from the contact us link in the site)

For more information see: [deleting datasets](deleting_datasets.html)

### Should I delete previous versions of a data file when a new version becomes available?

No, we keep historical versions once published, if the dataset is for a single file and a new version of that file is available, simply add it to the record if the data belongs to a time series simply add it.

### Our website has a lovely portal where we publish our data, can I just point to it?

You **must** provide a link to the data file itself, you can always add a link to your portal under the URL option in the extras section of the publishing wizard.

### How do I determine what data should be published in Data.gov.uk?

Any data file that is made public by your entity should have a dataset record in Data.gov.uk, the aim is to make as much data available as possible.
