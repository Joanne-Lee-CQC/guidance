### Do you have data about X?

You're invited to search the data.gov.uk data catalogue.

Try the data.gov.uk [search page](http://data.gov.uk/data/search) or read more about [finding data](finding_data.html).


### You don't have the dataset I want

Missing data can be requested using the 'Data Requests' process.

First [search the existing requests](http://data.gov.uk/data-request) and if it is not there, [create a request yourself](http://data.gov.uk/node/add/dataset-request).


### Can you tell me more about dataset X?

If important information about the dataset is unclear or missing from the dataset page then there are two ways to proceed:

1. Log-in and write a comment underneath the dataset. Other users might also have the same questions and others may well be able to answer them.

2. Contact the publisher of the data directly. To do this, the publisher should have filled in their contact details, which is visible by clicking on the dataset's 'envelope' icon.
