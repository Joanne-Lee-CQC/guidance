### Do you have data about X?

You're invited to search the data.gov.uk data catalogue.

Try the data.gov.uk [search page](http://data.gov.uk/data/search) or read more about [finding data](finding_data.html).


### You don't have the dataset I want

Missing data can be requested using the 'Data Requests' process.

First [search the existing requests](http://data.gov.uk/data-request) and if it is not there, [create a request yourself](http://data.gov.uk/node/add/dataset-request).


### Can you tell me more about dataset X?

If important information about the dataset is unclear or missing from the dataset page then there are a few ways to proceed:

1. Log-in and write a comment underneath the dataset. Other users might also have the same questions and others may well be able to answer them.

2. Contact the publisher of the data directly. To do this, the publisher should have filled in their contact details, which is visible by clicking on the dataset's 'envelope' icon.

3. Log-in and [create a Data Request](http://data.gov.uk/node/add/dataset-request) - describing in detail the information that is missing and the value of knowing it. The publisher of the data will be contacted and your request will be tracked.

### Can you provide me with data about X?

Firstly, see if the data is listed on data.gov.ukalready - see [Do you have data about X](#do-you-have-data-about-x)?

If the data is not listed but you believe it is collected by a public sector body, then log-in and [create a Data Request](http://data.gov.uk/node/add/dataset-request) - describing in detail the data that should be released and the value to the public of it being published. The holder of the data will be contacted and your request will be tracked.
